# Welcome
First thing to do is to clone this repository. When it's done, go to the _docker_ directory and run this command:
```bash
cp .env.dist .env
```

Now open .env file and set a domain of your choice and an absolute path to this project. Easy one.

# They see me rollin'
Ready, steady, go!
```bash
docker-compose up
```
No -d, you need to have your logs handy, don't you? ;)

# Some sugar
There are some nice bash commands available like first-run or build. Go there and check'em out.
